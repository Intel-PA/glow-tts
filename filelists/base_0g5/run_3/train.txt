DUMMY/LJ048-0203.wav|The three officers confirm that their primary concern was crowd and traffic control,

DUMMY/LJ010-0026.wav|There was no increase in murder or manslaughter; the number of such crimes remained pretty constant proportionately to population.

DUMMY/LJ037-0213.wav|Marina Oswald gave as her opinion that the mail-order coupon was in Oswald's handwriting.
DUMMY/LJ045-0034.wav|Marina Oswald attributed that to their living apart and to the imminent birth of their second child.

DUMMY/LJ031-0135.wav|Concern that the Vice President might also be a target for assassination prompted the Secret Service agents to urge him to leave the hospital and return to Washington immediately.
DUMMY/LJ030-0128.wav|From Main Street the motorcade turned right and went north on Houston Street, passing tall buildings on the right,
DUMMY/LJ034-0218.wav|The Commission has determined that the employee was in fact Billy Lovelady, who identified himself in the picture.
DUMMY/LJ049-0061.wav|No responsibility rests upon those agents near the President for the identification or arrest of any assassin or an attacker.
DUMMY/LJ015-0146.wav|He had a nice taste in bric-à-brac, and was considered a good judge of pictures.
DUMMY/LJ018-0350.wav|He might swear he was not the murderer, that he never fired a pistol in his life,

DUMMY/LJ043-0005.wav|Apart from his relatives, Oswald had no friends or close associates in Texas when he returned there in June of nineteen sixty-two,

DUMMY/LJ028-0228.wav|Cyrus, with the first approach of the ensuing spring, marched forward against Babylon.
DUMMY/LJ019-0114.wav|but Mr. Pearson overlooked some points in which a more practical mind would have foreseen difficulty, and perhaps forecasted failure.
DUMMY/LJ004-0036.wav|it was hoped that their rulers would hire accommodation in the county prisons, and that the inferior establishments would in course of time disappear.
DUMMY/LJ029-0044.wav|Lawson's most important responsibilities were to take preventive action against anyone in Dallas considered a threat to the President,
DUMMY/LJ049-0221.wav|perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the Cabinet-level committee recommended above or the National Security Council.
DUMMY/LJ040-0177.wav|He took the position that such matters were his own business.
DUMMY/LJ037-0218.wav|Marina Oswald testified that this was the holster which contained the revolver in the photographs taken on Neely Street.
DUMMY/LJ035-0094.wav|the Commission concluded that Oswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the second-floor lunchroom when seen by Baker and Truly.
DUMMY/LJ006-0136.wav|These wardsmen, besides thus ruling the roast, had numerous special privileges, if such they can be called.
DUMMY/LJ003-0054.wav|An imperfect attempt at classification was, however, made in eighteen twelve, and a yard was as far as possible set apart for the untried,

DUMMY/LJ040-0191.wav|Lee told Carro, his probation officer, that he liked to be by himself because he had too much difficulty in making friends.
DUMMY/LJ019-0172.wav|prisoners who had been acquitted were not permitted to return to the prison to show their joy and receive the congratulations of their unfortunate fellows.
DUMMY/LJ029-0149.wav|To control traffic, arrangements were made for the deployment of foot patrolmen and motorcycle police at various positions along the route.
DUMMY/LJ018-0022.wav|It was also easily established that the hat found in the carriage had been bought at Walker's, a hatter's in Crawford Street,
DUMMY/LJ012-0145.wav|Solomons was now also admitted as a witness, and his evidence, with that of Moss, secured the transportation of the principal actors in the theft.
DUMMY/LJ018-0153.wav|the officers ensconced themselves in the latter, and waited for Buncher's expected visit.
DUMMY/LJ032-0081.wav|On the Hidell Selective Service card there appeared a signature, "Alek J. Hidell,"
