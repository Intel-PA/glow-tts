AUGMENTED/LJ050-0253.wav_0.aug|that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.

AUGMENTED/LJ038-0092.wav_1.aug|Oswald provided little information during his questioning.
AUGMENTED/LJ004-0038.wav_0.aug|It was in eighteen seventeen that a small band of philanthropists resolved to form themselves into an association for the improvement of prison discipline.

AUGMENTED/LJ001-0145.wav_2.aug|No definite rules, however, except the avoidance of "rivers" and excess of white, can be given for the spacing,
