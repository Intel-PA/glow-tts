DUMMY/LJ031-0063.wav|When Dr. Perry noted free air and blood in the President's chest cavity, he asked that chest tubes be inserted to allow for drainage of blood and air.

DUMMY/LJ032-0071.wav|Oswald's use of the name "Hidell" to purchase the assassination weapon was one of several instances in which he used this name as an alias.

DUMMY/LJ043-0140.wav|He also studied Dallas bus schedules to prepare for his later use of buses to travel to and from General Walker's house.
DUMMY/LJ019-0041.wav|Other jurisdictions were less prompt to recognize their responsibilities, the city of London among the number, as I shall presently show at length.

DUMMY/LJ006-0040.wav|The fact was that the years as they passed, nearly twenty in all, had worked but little permanent improvement in this detestable prison.

DUMMY/LJ048-0252.wav|Three of these agents occupied positions on the running boards of the car, and the fourth was seated in the car.
DUMMY/LJ038-0047.wav|Some of the officers saw Oswald strike McDonald with his fist. Most of them heard a click which they assumed to be a click of the hammer of the revolver.
DUMMY/LJ030-0063.wav|He had repeated this wish only a few days before, during his visit to Tampa, Florida.
DUMMY/LJ034-0073.wav|Givens testified that after reaching the first floor, quote,

DUMMY/LJ046-0160.wav|A case file was established if the information available suggested that the subject might be a danger to the President.
DUMMY/LJ016-0248.wav|Marwood was proud of his calling, and when questioned as to whether his process was satisfactory, replied that he heard "no complaints."
DUMMY/LJ034-0128.wav|But the testimony of these employees, together with photographs subsequently taken of them at the scene of the assassination,

DUMMY/LJ021-0025.wav|And in many directions, the intervention of that organized control which we call government
DUMMY/LJ048-0228.wav|and others who were present say that no agent was inebriated or acted improperly.
DUMMY/LJ048-0183.wav|Admittedly, protective measures cannot ordinarily be taken with regard to all buildings along a motorcade route.
DUMMY/LJ049-0084.wav|Murder of the President has never been covered by Federal law, however, so that once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a single person,
